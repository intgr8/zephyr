        Human readable string describing the device and used to set the device
        name. It can be passed as argument to device_get_binding() to retrieve
        the device. If this property is omitted, then the device name is set
        from the node full name. This is not fully implemented.

          description: |
            GPIO pin configuration for serial signals (RX, TX, RTS, CTS).  We expect
            that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.

            For example the USART1 would be
              pinctrl-0 = <&usart1_tx_pb6 &usart1_rx_pb7>;

          description: |
            Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
            application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
            (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
